#### Working of the code
1. User needs to login using his personal credentials. New users will be asked to join and a 
new account will be created for them. 
2. If the given credentials match the data in the server, they can access the facilities and 
functions. 
3. After successful login, the user will be given five options 
* Encrypt a file 
* Decrypt a file 
* Download a file from the server database 
* Upload a file to the server from the clientâ€™s pc 
* Exit  
4. User will be logged out successfully after completing their task.

the modules present on your computer, and check and update your pip.
